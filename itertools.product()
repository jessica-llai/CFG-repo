# https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/itertools-product/problem?isFullScreen=true

You are given a two lists  and . Your task is to compute their cartesian product X.

Example

A = [1, 2]
B = [3, 4]

AxB = [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]
Note: A and B are sorted lists, and the cartesian product's tuples should be output in sorted order.

Input Format

The first line contains the space separated elements of list .
The second line contains the space separated elements of list .

Both lists have no duplicate integer elements.

Constraints



Output Format

Output the space separated tuples of the cartesian product.

```

from itertools import product 
import sys

s = [i.strip().split() for i in sys.stdin.readlines()]
s1 = [int(e) for e in s[0]]
s2 = [int(m) for m in s[1]]

for i in product(s1,s2):
    print(i, end=' ')
    


```
